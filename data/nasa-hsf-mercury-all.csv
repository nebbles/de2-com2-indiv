Failure	"Due to an electrical malfunction, the escape tower ignited Â_ hour before launch and took the spacecraft with it, leaving the rocket on the ground."Unmanned	Big Joe 1			09/9/1959			13 m 00 s			Test of heat shield and Atlas/spacecraft interface.	Partly success	"Actually the first Mercury-Atlas flight.[132] Recovered by USSÂ Strong 2,407Â km SE of Cape Canaveral.[230] Altitude: 65Â mi (105Â km) Qualified ablative heatshield."Unmanned	Little Joe 6			04/10/1959			5 m 10 s			Test of spacecraft aerodynamics and integrity.	Partly success	No additional testsUnmanned	Little Joe 1A			04/11/1959			8 m 11 s			Test of launch escape system during flight with boiler plate capsule.	Partly success	The rescue tower rocket ignited 10 seconds too late.[232] Recovered by USSÂ Opportune 11.5Â mi (18.5Â km) SE of Wallops Island.Unmanned	Little Joe 2			04/12/1959			11 m 6 s			Escape system test with primate at high altitude.	Success	"Carried Sam, a rhesus macaque.[232] Recovered by USSÂ Borie 194Â mi (312Â km) SE of Wallops Island, Virginia; altitude: 53Â mi (85Â km)."Unmanned	Little Joe 1B			21/1/1960			8 m 35 s			Maximum-q abort and escape test with primate with boiler plate capsule.	Success	Carried a female rhesus monkey named Miss Sam.Unmanned	Beach Abort			09/5/1960			1 m 31 s			Test of the off-the-pad abort system.	Success	"A boilerplate spacecraft was liftet from the ground by the lauch escape system alone at Wallops Island. It reached an apogee of 0.751 kilometres (2,465Â ft) and was recovered after landing. Top velocity: 436 metres per second (976Â mph). Total payload: 1,154Â kg."Unmanned	Mercury-Atlas 1			29/7/1960			3 m 18 s			Test of spacecraft / Atlas combination.	Failure	"Exploded while passing through max-q[236] To save weight, the airframe had been made thinner since Big Joe, which led to a collapse. The next Atlas was strengthened by a temporary solution while the rest were made from the same specifications as Big Joe."Unmanned	Little Joe 5			08/11/1960			2 m 22 s			First test of escape system with a production spacecraft.	Failure	"The clamp holding the spacecraft was deflected by air pressure; due to this and an incorrect wiring, the escape tower ignited too early and further failed to separate spacecraft from launch vehicle.[40][n 34] Altitude: 10Â mi (16Â km)"Unmanned	Mercury-Redstone 1			21/11/1960			2 s			Test of production spacecraft at max-q.	Failure	Engine shutdown caused by improper separation of electrical cables;[239] vehicle rose 4Â in (10Â cm) and settled back on the pad.[240][n 35]Unmanned	Mercury-Redstone 1A			19/12/1960			15 m 45 s			Qualification of spacecraft / Redstone combination.	Success	First flight of Mercury / Redstone. Recovered by USSÂ Valley Forge[241] Altitude: 130Â mi (210Â km)Unmanned	Mercury-Redstone 2			31/1/1961			16 m 39 s			Qualification of spacecraft with chimpanzee.	Success	Carried the chimpanzee Ham on suborbital flight. Recovered by USSÂ Donner[242] 422Â mi (679Â km) SE of Cape Canaveral; altitude: 157Â mi (253Â km)Unmanned	Mercury-Atlas 2			21/2/1961			17 m 56 s			Qualified Mercury/Atlas interface.	Success	"Recovered by USS Donner[244] 1,432Â mi (2,305Â km) SE of Cape Canaveral."Unmanned	Little Joe 5A			18/3/1961			23 m 48 s			Second test of escape system with a production Mercury spacecraft.	Partly success	Tower fired 14 seconds too soon; it failed to separate the spacecraft from the rocket.Unmanned	Mercury-Redstone BD			24/3/1961			8 m 23 s			Final Redstone test flight.	Success	BD: Booster Development)Unmanned	Mercury-Atlas 3			25/4/1961			7 m 19 s			Orbital flight with robot astronaut.[226][227][n 33]	Failure	Upgraded from suborbital flight. Was aborted when it did not go into orbit; boiler plate capsule recovered and reused in Mercury-Atlas 4.Unmanned	Little Joe 5B			28/4/1961			5 m 25 s			Third test of escape system with a production spacecraft.	Success	Concluded Little Joe program.Unmanned	Mercury-Atlas 4			13/9/1961			1 h 49 m 20 s			Test of environmental control system with robot astronaut in orbit.	Success	Completed one orbit and sent data to the ground; first orbital flight of the project.[248] Recovery by USSÂ Decatur 176Â mi (283Â km) east of Bermuda.Unmanned	Mercury-Scout 1			01/11/1961			44 s			Test of Mercury tracking network.	Failure	Was aborted after malfunction of guidance system;[250] results of Mercury-Atlas 4 and Mercury-Atlas 5 were used instead.Unmanned	Mercury-Atlas 5			29/11/1961			3 h 20 m 59 s			Test of environmental control system in orbit with chimpanzee.	Success	"Chimpanzee Enos completed a two-orbit flight, performing tasks to prove it possible for a person to function during a flight.[252][n 36] Last Mercury-Atlas test flight. Recovery by USSÂ Stormes[254] 255Â mi (410Â km) SE of Bermuda."
