"Gemini 1","GLV-1 12556","","","8–12 April 1964","16:00 UTC","03d 23h1"
"First test flight of Gemini; spacecraft was intentionally destroyed during re-entry 1: The mission duration was 4h 50m, sufficient to achieve all of the mission aims in three orbits; the spacecraft remained in orbit for 3d 23h."
"Gemini 2","GLV-2 12557","","","19 January 1965","14:04 UTC","00d 00h 18m 16s"
"Suborbital flight to test heat shield"
"Manned"
"Gemini 3","GLV-3 12558","Grissom","Young","23 March 1965","14:24 UTC","00d 04h 52m 31s"
"First manned Gemini flight, three orbits."
"Gemini IV","GLV-4 12559","McDivitt","White","3–7 June 1965","15:16 UTC","04d 01h 56m 12s"
"Included first extravehicular activity (EVA) by an American; White's ""space walk"" was a 22-minute EVA exercise."
"Gemini V","GLV-5 12560","Cooper","Conrad","21–29 August 1965","14:00 UTC","07d 22h 55m 14s"
"First week-long flight; first use of fuel cells for electrical power; evaluated guidance and navigation system for future rendezvous missions. Completed 120 orbits."
"Gemini VII","GLV-7 12562","Borman","Lovell","4–18 December 1965","19:30 UTC","13d 18h 35m 01s"
"When the original Gemini VI mission was scrubbed because the launch of its Agena docking target failed, Gemini VII was used as the rendezvous target instead. Primary objective was to determine whether humans could live in space for 14 days."
"Gemini VI-A","GLV-6 12561","Schirra","Stafford","15–16 December 1965","13:37 UTC","01d 01h 51m 24s"
"First space rendezvous accomplished with Gemini VII, station-keeping for over five hours at distances from 1 to 300 feet (0.30 to 91 m)."
"Gemini VIII","GLV-8 12563","Armstrong","Scott","16–17 March 1966","16:41 UTC","00d 10h 41m 26s"
"Accomplished first docking with another space vehicle, an unmanned Agena Target Vehicle. While docked, a Gemini spacecraft thruster malfunction caused near-fatal tumbling of the craft, which, after undocking, Armstrong was able to overcome; the crew effected the first emergency landing of a manned U.S. space mission."
"Gemini IX-A","GLV-9 12564","Stafford","Cernan","3–6 June 1966","13:39 UTC","03d 00h 20m 50s"
"Rescheduled from May to rendezvous and dock with the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA) after the original Agena Target Vehicle launch failed. The ATDA shroud did not completely separate, making docking impossible. Three different types of rendezvous, two hours of EVA, and 44 orbits were completed."
"Gemini X","GLV-10 12565","Young","Collins","18–21 July 1966","22:20 UTC","02d 22h 46m 39s"
"First use of the Agena Target Vehicle's propulsion systems. The spacecraft also rendezvoused with the Agena Target Vehicle from Gemini VIII. Collins had 49 minutes of EVA standing in the hatch and 39 minutes of EVA to retrieve experiments from the Agena. 43 orbits completed."
"Gemini XI","GLV-11 12566","Conrad","Gordon","12–15 September 1966","14:42 UTC","02d 23h 17m 09s"
"Gemini record altitude with apogee of 739.2 nautical miles (1,369.0 km)[17] reached using the Agena Target Vehicle propulsion system after first orbit rendezvous and docking. Gordon made a 33-minute EVA and two-hour standup EVA. 44 orbits."
"Gemini XII","GLV-12 12567","Lovell","Aldrin","11–15 November 1966","20:46 UTC","03d 22h 34m 31s"
"Final Gemini flight. Rendezvoused and docked manually with its target Agena and kept station with it during EVA. Aldrin set an EVA record of 5 hours and 30 minutes for one space walk and two stand-up exercises, and demonstrated solutions to previous EVA problems. 59 orbits completed"
