"Remarks"
"Little Joe 1","Due to an electrical malfunction, the escape tower ignited ½ hour before launch and took the spacecraft with it, leaving the rocket on the ground."
"Big Joe 1","Actually the first Mercury-Atlas flight.[132] Recovered by USS Strong 2,407 km SE of Cape Canaveral.[230] Altitude: 65 mi (105 km) Qualified ablative heatshield."
"Little Joe 6","No additional tests"
"Little Joe 1A","The rescue tower rocket ignited 10 seconds too late.[232] Recovered by USS Opportune 11.5 mi (18.5 km) SE of Wallops Island."
"Little Joe 2","Carried Sam, a rhesus macaque.[232] Recovered by USS Borie 194 mi (312 km) SE of Wallops Island, Virginia; altitude: 53 mi (85 km)."
"Little Joe 1B","Carried a female rhesus monkey named Miss Sam."
"Beach Abort","A boilerplate spacecraft was liftet from the ground by the lauch escape system alone at Wallops Island. It reached an apogee of 0.751 kilometres (2,465 ft) and was recovered after landing. Top velocity: 436 metres per second (976 mph). Total payload: 1,154 kg."
"Mercury-Atlas 1","Exploded while passing through max-q[236] To save weight, the airframe had been made thinner since Big Joe, which led to a collapse. The next Atlas was strengthened by a temporary solution while the rest were made from the same specifications as Big Joe."
"Little Joe 5","The clamp holding the spacecraft was deflected by air pressure; due to this and an incorrect wiring, the escape tower ignited too early and further failed to separate spacecraft from launch vehicle.[40][n 34] Altitude: 10 mi (16 km)"
"Mercury-Redstone 1","Engine shutdown caused by improper separation of electrical cables;[239] vehicle rose 4 in (10 cm) and settled back on the pad.[240][n 35]"
"Mercury-Redstone 1A","First flight of Mercury / Redstone. Recovered by USS Valley Forge[241] Altitude: 130 mi (210 km)"
"Mercury-Redstone 2","Carried the chimpanzee Ham on suborbital flight. Recovered by USS Donner[242] 422 mi (679 km) SE of Cape Canaveral; altitude: 157 mi (253 km)"
"Mercury-Atlas 2","Recovered by USS Donner[244] 1,432 mi (2,305 km) SE of Cape Canaveral."
"Little Joe 5A","Tower fired 14 seconds too soon; it failed to separate the spacecraft from the rocket."
"Mercury-Redstone BD","BD: Booster Development)"
"Mercury-Atlas 3","Upgraded from suborbital flight. Was aborted when it did not go into orbit; boiler plate capsule recovered and reused in Mercury-Atlas 4."
"Little Joe 5B","Concluded Little Joe program."
"Mercury-Atlas 4","Completed one orbit and sent data to the ground; first orbital flight of the project.[248] Recovery by USS Decatur 176 mi (283 km) east of Bermuda."
"Mercury-Scout 1","Was aborted after malfunction of guidance system;[250] results of Mercury-Atlas 4 and Mercury-Atlas 5 were used instead."
"Mercury-Atlas 5","Chimpanzee Enos completed a two-orbit flight, performing tasks to prove it possible for a person to function during a flight.[252][n 36] Last Mercury-Atlas test flight. Recovery by USS Stormes[254] 255 mi (410 km) SE of Bermuda."
